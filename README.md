# JavaFX Calculator Project

## Project Overview

This project is a graphical calculator application developed using JavaFX. The calculator showcases the integration of JavaFX for building a modern and interactive user interface while implementing core programming principles in Java. This repository demonstrates an object-oriented approach to software development and serves as an educational tool for understanding GUI-based application design.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **User Interface**:
   - Developed with JavaFX to provide a clean and intuitive GUI.

3. **Modular Design**:
   - Encapsulated logic for operations and UI components in separate classes.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles invalid input, such as division by zero, with appropriate error messages.

5. **Enum for Operators**:
   - Utilizes Java enumerations for managing operator logic.
